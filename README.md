Our test (run "npm test") fails. For some reason the code says "Missing pos_id".
Your task is to find the bug that is causing the error and eliminate it.

1. Please make changes only to index.js file.
1. Please describe the issue you've found, the fix you implemented and what is the root cause.

Good luck!
